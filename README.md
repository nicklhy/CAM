This demo shows the method proposed in "Zhou, Bolei, et al. "Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization." arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.04150 (2015)".

The proposed method can automatically localize the discriminative regions in an image using global average pooling
(GAP) in CNNs.

You can download the pretrained Inception-V3 network from [here](http://data.dmlc.ml/mxnet/models/imagenet/inception-v3.tar.gz). Other networks with similar structure(use global average pooling after the last conv feature map) should also work.
